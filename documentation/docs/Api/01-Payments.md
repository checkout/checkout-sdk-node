You can find a list of request body parameters and possible outcomes [here](https://api-reference.checkout.com/#tag/Payments).

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
<span
style={{
      color: color,
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
{children}
</span>
);

## Request a card payment with a <Highlight color="#25c2a0">card token</Highlight>

The card token is generated by on of the Front End integration options like [Checkout.Frames](https://docs.checkout.com/docs/frames)or one of the [Mobile SDKs](https://docs.checkout.com/docs/sdks#section-mobile-sdk-libraries). Keep in mind that this token expires in 15 minutes, and it's a single time use token.

```js
const payment = await cko.payments.request({
    source: {
        // type:"token" is inferred
        token: 'tok_bzi43qc6jeee5mmnfo4gnsnera',
    },
    customer: {
        email: 'user@email.com',
        name: 'James Bond',
    },
    currency: 'EUR',
    amount: 1000, // cents
    reference: 'ORDER123',
});
```

## Request a card payment with a <Highlight color="#25c2a0">full card details</Highlight>

:::warning

You need to have a high level of PCI Compliance (SAQ-D) to be able to send requests with full card details. Note that unless this payment option is enabled on your account by Checkout.com, the <Highlight color="#5A522C">request will fail</Highlight>. Contact you account manager to request access for this payment interaction.

:::

```js
const payment = await cko.payments.request({
    source: {
        // type:"card" is inferred
        number: '4242424242424242',
        expiry_month: 6,
        expiry_year: 2029,
        cvv: '100',
    },
    customer: {
        email: 'user@email.com',
        name: 'James Bond',
    },
    currency: 'EUR',
    amount: 1000, // cents
    reference: 'ORDER123',
});
```

## Request a card payment with a <Highlight color="#25c2a0">an existing card</Highlight>

After you perform at least one successful payment for a customer, Checkout.com will return a <Highlight color="#02b48f">source.id</Highlight>. This id does not expire, so it can be used perform payments without needing the customer to enter the card details again.

```js
const payment = await cko.payments.request({
    source: {
        // type:"id" is inferred
        id: 'src_vg3tm54ndfbefotjlmgrrvbxli',
    },
    customer: {
        email: 'user@email.com',
        name: 'James Bond',
    },
    currency: 'EUR',
    amount: 1000, // cents
    reference: 'ORDER123',
});
```

## Request a card payment with a <Highlight color="#25c2a0">an existing customer</Highlight>

After you perform at least one successful payment for a customer, Checkout.com will return a <Highlight color="#02b48f">customer.id</Highlight>. This id can be used perform payments without needing the customer to enter the card details again.

```js
const payment = await cko.payments.request({
    source: {
        // type:"customer" is inferred
        id: 'cus_6artgoevd77u7ojah2wled32sa',
    },
    currency: 'EUR',
    amount: 1000, // cents
    reference: 'ORDER123',
});
```

## Request a payment for a <Highlight color="#25c2a0">local payment method</Highlight>

The [API Reference](https://api-reference.checkout.com/) contains a list of local payment options that you can use, as well as the other information required in the payment source (if required)

This is an example of a payment request for <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Sofort</Highlight>:

```js
const response = await cko.payments.request({
    source: {
        type: 'sofort',
    },
    currency: 'EUR', // Sofort only works with EUR
    amount: 1000,
});
```

As you can see from the [API Reference](https://api-reference.checkout.com/) this request is meant to return a redirection URL, so you can let the customer complete the transaction on the local payment's website. Normally a successful response would look like this:

```json
{
    "id": "pay_y3gars76cvrudairph27ekzpvm",
    "status": "Pending",
    "customer": {
        "id": "cus_zbsnutwm2hoevnxnyj6o26sibe"
    },
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_y3gars76cvrudairph27ekzpvm"
        },
        "redirect": {
            "href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/LP.Core/api/payment/191952"
        }
    }
}
```

To make it easier to access the redirection URL, instead of accessing it as <Highlight color="#25c2a0">response.\_links.redirect.href</Highlight> the response body is appended with a parameter called <Highlight color="#25c2a0">redirectLink</Highlight> by the SDK, so the same URL will be accessible as <Highlight color="#25c2a0">response.redirectLink</Highlight>

## Request a <Highlight color="#25c2a0">3D Secure payment</Highlight>

You have the ability to request 3DS in a payment request. The request body is similar to normal card payments, but with some additional parameters. [Read more about 3DS](https://docs.checkout.com/docs/3d-secure-payments)

```js
const payment = await cko.payments.request({
    source: {
        // type:"token" is inferred
        token: 'tok_bzi43qc6jeee5mmnfo4gnsnera',
    },
    '3ds': {
        enabled: true,
    },
    customer: {
        email: 'user@email.com',
        name: 'James Bond',
    },
    currency: 'EUR',
    amount: 1000, // cents
    reference: 'ORDER123',
});
```

Similar to local payment options, 3D Secure payments will return a redirection URL. Here is an example of a 3DS response:

```json
{
    "id": "pay_krq2q22lblsevfkay2gfyvatta",
    "status": "Pending",
    "customer": {
        "id": "cus_c5c7d5f4avnehbhhgmnkdadkdu"
    },
    "3ds": {
        "downgraded": false,
        "enrolled": "Y"
    },
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_krq2q22lblsevfkay2gfyvatta"
        },
        "redirect": {
            "href": "https://3ds2-sandbox.ckotech.co/interceptor/3ds_dr6us33uu57utjwh7yl5szcgqy"
        }
    }
}
```

To make it easier to access the redirection URL, instead of accessing it as <Highlight color="#25c2a0">response.\_links.redirect.href</Highlight> the response body is appended with a parameter called <Highlight color="#25c2a0">redirectLink</Highlight> by the SDK, so the same URL will be accessible as <Highlight color="#25c2a0">response.redirectLink</Highlight>

## Handle card <Highlight color="#25c2a0">payment responses</Highlight>

Payment requests are influenced by risk rules so you can have situations where a card payment is requested without 3D Secure, but upgraded by a risk rule, resulting in a 3D Secure response. You are free to handle the response in any way you want, but bellow you have a good example for a starting point:

```js
try {
    const payment = await cko.payments.request({...});

    if (payment.status === 'Pending') {
      // The payment is 3DS. Redirect the customer to payment.redirectLink
    } else if (approved == true && risk.flagged == false) {
      // The payment was successful and not flagged by any risk rule
    } else if (approved == true && risk.flagged == true) {
      // The payment was successful but it was flagged by a risk rule; this means you have to manually decide if you want to capture it or void it
    } else if (approved == false) {
      // the payment was declined
    }

} catch (error) {
    console.log(error.name);
}
```

## Get payment details

```js
const details = await cko.payments.get('pay_je5hbbb4u3oe7k4u3lbwlu3zkq'); // or with session id sid_XX
```

## Get payment actions

```js
const actions = await cko.payments.getActions('pay_juevt3h5mcjulir2t5g3wfug6u');
```

## Capture a payment

```js
const payment = await cko.payments.capture(paymentId, {
    reference: 'CAPTURE-REF',
}); // you can also pass the idempotency key as the third argument
```

## Refund a payment

```js
const payment = await cko.payments.refund(paymentId, {
    amount: 50,
    reference: 'REFUND-REF',
}); // you can also pass the idempotency key as the third argument
```

## Void a payment

```js
const payment = await cko.payments.void(paymentId, {
    reference: 'VOID-REF',
}); // you can also pass the idempotency key as the third argument
```
